          <div class="project-description">We were approached by Nike to create an Experience that “made people move” and that’s exactly what we did. I was in charge of the research and technical validation of what was possible with the technology and worked very closely with the Creative Director in coming up with the experience. Once we started production I was in charge of the experience design and flow, some of the art direction and the technical implementation.</div>

          <div class="project-description">Working on Race the Pace we had to meet two main Key Performance indicators: Make People Move and Make it fun.<br>‍<br>For a lot of people when they think of Social AR the first thought that comes to their mind is the “beauty filters” on Instagram. And to be hones, given the way the Social AR space has developed, this can be true in a lot of cases. While other platforms like Snapchat or TikTok had more effective Body tracking at the time, Nike wanted to develop a full body experience in Instagram which presented its unique challenges particularly how to validate movement without body tracking. To solve this problem we went to the oldest validation system: our peers.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="w-layout-grid gridcontent">
        <div id="w-node-_16d9858f-c355-e2b7-e490-b62dde9f2ce3-2ea39938" class="side-title">A SOCIAL EXPERIENCE THAT IS REALLY SOCIAL</div>
        <div id="w-node-_16d9858f-c355-e2b7-e490-b62dde9f2ce5-2ea39938">
          <div class="project-description">Researching multiple Instagram Filters that dealt with the issue of point keeping or success/failure without actual validation, we saw a consistent workaround: Social validation. Instagram challenges like the sign challenge do not use computer vision to keep track of points, but use the “share” option as a way of validate your performance with your peers. <br><br>When we started thinking of Race The Pace and what form it would take we very quickly decided that it would work the best as an experience that is meant to be shared. This meant that what happened before “Record” and after “Record” had to be treated as almost two different stages on the whole process. This approach gave us the freedom to design a very robust user flow, where the first stage is focused mostly in making sure the user only needs to record once giving clear instructions to both the runner and the phone holder, and the second stage is mostly focused in creating a fun shareable experience.</div>

        <div id="w-node-_46cdd001-5410-4028-7b93-d82b1a254638-2ea39938">
          <div class="project-description">A thing to remember when working on Social AR is that unlike other interactive experiences where users trying something for the first time they do not know what to expect, when a user opens an AR experience in social media, they’ve already seen someone else using it and they have an idea of how to interact with the experience creating trends or memes.<br><br>When planning the User Flow for Race The Pace, that first interaction where the user is seeing either a friend or an influencer using the experience became the starting point of the user Journey. Because the experience has longer setup that what is usually seen on social AR, we needed to make sure the payoff was big and was worth it. This becomes even more important while considering this an experience that requires two users: the one running and the one holding the phone. Making the resulting recording of the user running next to a super fun 3D character followed by the results screen impactful enough was critical.<br></div>

            <div class="project-description">Here are some of core the decisions we made to create a successful experience.</div>

      <div class="div-block-49">
        <ul role="list">
          <li class="project-description">The first two instructions are: “Go Outside With A Friend” and “Find a Flat and Well Lit Space”: We wanted to make sure the user trying the experience had to restart it the least times possible. Stating the two main conditions from the beginning, made it so the user could decide right there and then if they could engage with the ARE immediately or needed to come back later once the conditions were met.</li>
          <li class="project-description">One of the biggest challenges on this experience was deciding when to ask the user to pick their pace. Even though we were using Instagram default UI Picker, we wanted to introduce the characters early. But introducing them too early when the track wasn’t already set didn’t feel natural. On the other hand waiting to introduce the characters in the track starting line felt like it left the experience running for two long without any sort of exciting payoff. We decided that making it part of the “Tap the screen to place your track” was both an exciting surprise but also made sense from the timing standpoint. At this moment of the experience, both the racer and the phone holder would be on the same place and it would allow the runner to also make part of the selection process</li>
          <li class="project-description">We built instructions that are meant to be visible only during recording but not on the final recorded version. This instructions are meant to give clarity to the phone holder about what is meant to happen at every stage</li>
          <li class="project-description">The Results screen: We wanted to create a culminating point to the experience that worked as a shareable bit. The result screens brings the attention back to the “racing” point of the experience, but also allowed us to have some sort of validation by tracking the amount of time it took to the runner to complete the track.</li>
